## **Courses Taught**  

### **76-101 Interpretation and Argument: Hello World: Texts & Tech***
**Semester:** Fall 2024  
**Course Description:** This foundational writing course examines the evolving relationship between writing and technology. Students develop critical reading and analytical writing skills while exploring how digital tools such as Grammarly, ChatGPT, GitHub, and LaTeX impact academic writing and knowledge production. Practical exercises using Zotero, Google Docs, and Tableau help students engage with writing as an interactive and evolving intellectual practice.  
**Curriculum Development:** I designed this course to integrate foundational writing pedagogy with critical engagement in digital transformation, emphasizing collaboration, process-based writing, and technological literacy.

### **76-221 Books You Should Have Read By Now: Asian American Literature**  
**Semester:** Summer 2, 2024  
**Course Description:** An introduction to Asian American literature, featuring works by Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean American authors. The course explores how these texts construct, challenge, and redefine Asian American identity, situating them within their historical, social, and political contexts.  
**Curriculum Development:** I proposed this course to fill a curricular gap and better reflect the diverse student body at Carnegie Mellon University. By incorporating multiple genres and theoretical perspectives, I foster discussions that are both reflective and critical.

### **76-207 DiverCities: Multiculturalism and North American Cities**  
**Semester:** Spring 2024  
**Course Description:** This course investigates urban multiculturalism through the experiences of immigrant families, international students, and transnational workers. Focusing on Los Angeles, New York City, and Toronto, students analyze how these cities function as sites of cultural intersection.  
**Curriculum Development:** Designed to align with my research on multiculturalism and transnationalism, this course connects urban studies, diaspora studies, and literature. By drawing on students' lived experiences, it encourages critical engagement with city spaces** and global migration.

### **76-107 Writing About Data**  
**Semesters:** Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023  
**Course Description:** This course equips students with the skills to interpret, analyze, and argue with data in both academic and popular genres. Students learn to critically engage with quantitative and qualitative data, making complex arguments accessible to diverse audiences.  
**Instructional (Re)Design:** Recognizing the challenges students face in adapting to new writing genres (IMRD, literature reviews), I implemented a structured scaffolded learning model, incorporating: (1) Brief reviews of key concepts; (2) Individual writing tasks linked to prior lessons; (3) Collaborative activities; (4) Summary lectures to reinforce learning. This model improved attendance, participation, and engagement** while promoting cognitive flexibility in writing.

### **76-106 Writing About Literature - Diasporic Literature: Home and (Be)Longing**  
**Semesters:** Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, Spring 2022  
**Course Description:** This course explores the concept of home ‚Äî both as a place of belonging and as a space of loss and displacement ‚Äî through diasporic literature. Students analyze vignettes, poetry, and graphic literature by African, Caribbean, Asian, and European diasporic writers, using theoretical lenses on trauma, melancholy, loss, and citizenship.  
**Curriculum Development:** I developed this theme after TA-ing a mini-semester course on Graphic Literature, aiming to introduce students to the complex narratives of so-called "home." I redesigned daily activities and integrated theoretical readings to strengthen students' ability to write theoretical lens papers with depth and nuance.
