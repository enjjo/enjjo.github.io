My research sits at the intersection of diasporic literature, transnational and mobility studies, and urban geography, integrating close reading with digital humanities methods to examine cultural practices and representations. By analyzing diasporic narratives and their circulation, I aim to empower urban communities by challenging exclusionary spatial practices and exploring creative ways to foster diversity and inclusivity in city spaces.

## **Current Project**  
### [Diaspora Voices in Translation: Building a Digital Archive of Translated Works Post-9/11](https://next-test-one-henna.vercel.app/)  

**Funding:** Twice supported by [departmental research grants](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/dei/project-funds.html).  

This project traces how U.S.-based diasporic literature circulates in the Korean book market, analyzing patterns of translation, marketing, and transnational cultural exchange. I compiled a bibliometric dataset of approximately 300 works, mapping how diasporic texts are categorized, marketed, and translated, while identifying the publishers, translators, and institutions mediating this process.  

### **Key Findings**  
- Diasporic novels are rarely marketed as “diaspora literature” in South Korea.  
- Instead, they are categorized under detective fiction, women’s fiction, or international literary awards, etc. often obscuring racial and migratory themes.  
- This work critically interrogates who defines and controls diasporic representation—critics, publishers, booksellers, or readers.  

By bridging diaspora studies, literary markets, translation studies, and digital humanities, this research contributes to contemporary debates on the global circulation of literature and the politics of categorization. This project extends into my dissertation by examining how diasporic literature produced in the U.S. is repackaged and marketed for international audiences. Rather than simply reflecting the experiences of American readerships, diasporic sensibilities travel, shaping global readerships beyond U.S. borders.
