## (Re)Routing My Way to Defense  
🗓️ March 1, 2024 

I still remember a conversation with my advisor during my Master’s program. I had just finished reading *Love Enough* and said, “This novel needs a map.” The emotional and spatial landscapes felt inseparable, and I believed visualizing them geographically would offer new insight. But at the time, I was told mapping literature wasn’t a “scholarly” approach.

So instead, I wrote on *What We All Long For*, another novel by Dionne Brand, whose works I deeply admire and cherish. (I always return and turn to her novels, as they remind me why I set out on this path to study literature and culture. Her novels are my signposts.)

Years later, as a PhD student, I returned to *Love Enough*, and it became part of my dissertation after all.

While mapping per se does not interest me as much, that early intuition shaped my scholarship. As with my thesis, I explore literary texts through a systematic and comparative approach. Connecting the dots between a larger number of texts and building a body of evidence to crystallize and support a working concept, or confirm an intuitive hunch, is thrilling. Over the years of working on my dissertation, I have become increasingly comfortable experimenting with different ways of reading and writing. I sometimes get lost along the way, but I continue learning as I find my way back to the research questions that anchor my work.

I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to pursue the research I once dreamed of, supported by the patience, kindness, shared enthusiasm, and generosity of my mentors, I’m even more excited to soon share it with my mentors and friends.
